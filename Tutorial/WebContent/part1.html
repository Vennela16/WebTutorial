    <h3>What is Webmining</h3>
    <p class="tab">
    Most people are familiar with the concept of data mining. Two types of people do data mining in our popular consciousness- social media companies like Facebook or Twitter use it to examine your metadata (location, browser, etc) on your posts and profiles as well as link that metadata to the information that you personally publish in your posts. They link this metadata with your publicized information to create a pretty cohesive profile of you to target ads to you. Hackers, the more nefarious type of the two, might use that data to guess your passwords, track your location, break into your bank accounts and so on. So data mining very much has a sort of subversive reputation, its assumed that its being used to take advantage of us or invade our privacy. But it's important to recognize that there are subsets of data mining that focus on mining particular parts of the wide swath of data available on the Internet, types that are a fair bit less subversive. Web mining can be seen as one of these types: its goal is not necessarily to exploit users, but rather to mine websites themselves and examine their patterns.
Like data mining, web mining accomplishes its goal of pattern recognition by using automated programs to extract particular data from webpages like browser activities, server logs, website and link structure, page content, among others. The purpose of this data extraction is to analyze it, discovering the aforementioned patterns. Its commercial use is to examine successful website design and diagnose what makes that website so good at user engagement. A web mining company can figure out what designs attract the most users and most engagement and sell this data to companies looking to improve their websites. Though web mining is a subcategory of data mining, it itself has its own subcategories.

    <h3>Categories Of Webmining</h3>
    <p class="tab">
Web mining can be split into three separate categories- web content mining, web structure mining, and web usage mining. Web content mining focuses on the structure of the inner-document details of a webpage, ie the particular peculiarities that separate a particular webpage from the more broad, barebones schema that it derives from. Web structure mining is focused on the inter-document structure of a webpage, referring to its hyperlink structure, ie the way in which the web page displays routing to other pages to users and how that's formatted in the code. Lastly, web usage mining covers which aspects of the webpage are generating the most interest from users. This type of web mining is the one that most resembles our popular conception of data mining and is the most sought after type commercially- there's not as much money in the other two as there is in finding out what web design types keep people clicking. For our project in particular, we're covering web content mining out of all of the web mining categories.
