    As we've shown, web content mining's algorithms have several important variables to their utility- scalability, meaning its relation to examination of wide swaths of data that can come from wide swaths of data on single pages, multiple pages, or multiple sites usability, referring to its user interface friendliness and expedience of its mining, and primacy, meaning that web content mining can pinpoint the data that is most important to answer queries posed to the algorithm. Web content mining's objective is to gather, organize, categorize, and provide the user with the best possible information available per website being examined. Presently, web page content extraction is a critical step in data analysis of many technologies. This process will become increasingly difficult (and perhaps more important) as time goes on with websites getting more complex in their content and their organization of that content- web content mining algorithms will have to adapt to changes in future design as well as always be moving forward on the usability and the scalability of its algorithms.
